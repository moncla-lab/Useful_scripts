# Useful_scripts
This is a repo for dropping useful scripts and code for lab activities.

Clara - I have added the following scripts
- /Useful_scripts/fasta_python_scripts/select-strains-from-fasta-metadata.ipynb - this script selects strains in either a FASTA or metadata.tsv from those listed in a TXT 
- /Useful_scripts/fasta_python_scripts/select-strains-from-fasta.ipynb - this script selects strains in a metadata.tsv from only the strains in a FASTA 
- /Useful_scripts/dataframe-manipulation/subset-to-dataframe-columns.ipynb - this script subsets a dataframe down to a few chosen columns
- /Useful_scripts/convert-strings-to-decimaldates.ipynb - this script converts strings of "Month Day Year" to decimal dates_
